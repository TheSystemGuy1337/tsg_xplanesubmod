# tsg_xplanesubmod
This was a once undisclosed private submod I had lying around ready to distribute, however, due to the MAStools controversy, it was left in a desk drawer to rot. UNTIL NOW.

# IMPORTANT

This submod is so lazy, it borrows some code from Dale's Reactionary submod, however, the code in question is too generic to possibly be protected by copyright, so it was used anyway. If you are Dale, or are the legal copyright holder of Dale's Reactionary and believe I am infringing your copyright, send all DMCA takedown requests and legal complaints to u/TheSystemGuy on Reddit or TheSystemGuy#0737 on Discord.

# Public domain disclosure 

This derivative of Dales Reactionary is public domain software, however, Dales Reactionary itself is not public domain software and is protected by US copyright law. This has been altered enough to the point that it is considered fair use. I cannot guarantee that your appication of this code is fair use, so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

# Can I learn from this?

Yes. In fact, you will definitely learn to not do the same mistakes as I did when making this, This source code is ideal for people starting out with MAS submmodding
